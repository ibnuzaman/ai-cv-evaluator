# Project Evaluation Guidelines

## Technical Implementation
- Code quality and organization
- Appropriate design patterns and architecture
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance considerations
- Security practices

## Project Complexity
- Low: Simple CRUD applications, minimal business logic
- Medium: Multiple integrations, moderate business logic
- High: Complex systems, advanced algorithms, scalability considerations

## Documentation Quality
- README completeness
- Code comments and documentation
- API documentation
- Setup and deployment instructions
- Project structure explanation

## Testing
- Test coverage
- Types of tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- Test quality and effectiveness
- Test organization

## Problem Solving Approach
- Problem understanding
- Solution design process
- Alternative approaches considered
- Justification for technical choices

## Project Score Calculation (0.0-10.0)
- 9.0-10.0: Exceptional - professional quality, production-ready
- 8.0-8.9: Excellent - well-implemented with minor improvements possible
- 7.0-7.9: Very good - solid implementation with some areas to improve
- 6.0-6.9: Good - functional but with several areas needing improvement
- 5.0-5.9: Satisfactory - meets basic requirements but needs significant improvement
- Below 5.0: Unsatisfactory - major issues in implementation
